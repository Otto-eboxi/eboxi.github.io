(This is just a copy of the text original published on the Beoworld that was unfortunately removed)
The power switch on some of the Beomaster's tend to fail. I could not find instructions how to remove it anywhere, so in case it will help anyone this is how I removed mine.
Step 1:Open the unit, remove and disassemble the front panel
The front panel is tricky because its got lots of screws and some are hidden and in difficult positions (maybe I will do a post about it later)</description></item></channel></rss>
