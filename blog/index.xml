Background Like all older B&amp;amp;O systems, the Beomaster 4000 uses filament lamps. In most of the vintage B&amp;amp;O's these lamps are soldered in but the lamps in the Beomaster 4000 fits into a holder. If replaced, ideally with LEDs, these should just directly fit into these holders. To complicate replacement, the one lamp (red power) runs from 22V AC while the others run from about 13-14V DC.</description></item><item><title>Emoji Support</title><link>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/emoji-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/emoji-support/</guid><description>&lt;p>Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a New Theme</title><link>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/creating-a-new-theme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/creating-a-new-theme/</guid><description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I'll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won't cover using CSS to style your theme.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Hugo</title><link>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/hugoisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/hugoisforlovers/</guid><description>Step 1.
