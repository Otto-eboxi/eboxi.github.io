With compose theme, you can use mermaid using a custom shortcode as follows:

Solar monitor mainly written in python running on Raspberry Pi.
The idea is to only use local devices (no external server): Raspberri Pi as local server and ESP's as nodes.</description></item><item><title>A solar power optimizer</title><link>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blogiot/solaroptimizer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 14:30:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blogiot/solaroptimizer/</guid><description>Summary Still a work in progres. The idea is to monitor the solar generation and load scheduling and, based on the prediction, optimize the scheduleling of the high power loads, e.g. geyser and pool pump.

Background (Note this was first published on beoworld.org in 2021 but they removed the old posts) Like a lot older B&amp;amp;O systems, the Beomaster 4000 uses filament lamps. In most of the vintage B&amp;amp;O's these lamps are soldered but the lamps in the Beomaster 4000 fits into a holder. An ideal replacement would be LED's that directly fit into these holders.</description></item><item><title>Beomaster 4000 Power Switch Repair</title><link>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blogarc/beo4swfix/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:30:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blogarc/beo4swfix/</guid><description>Fixing the power switch
(This is just a copy of the text original published on the Beoworld that was unfortunately removed)
A broken switch often starts off with some intermittent on/off switching. Normally the resistance across the switch contacts is higher than expected (less than about 2-3 ohm I would guess is normal) or vary a lot (5-25 ohm in my case).
Unfortunately replacements are not available, unless you can find a second hand one.</description></item><item><title>Beomaster 4000 Power Switch Removal</title><link>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/beo4swremove/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 14:30:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/blog/beo4swremove/</guid><description>Removing the power switch
(This is just a copy of the text original published on the Beoworld that was unfortunately removed)
The power switch on some of the Beomaster's tend to fail. I could not find instructions how to remove it anywhere, so in case it will help anyone this is how I removed mine.
Step 1:Open the unit, remove and disassemble the front panel
The front panel is tricky because its got lots of screws and some are hidden and in difficult positions (maybe I will do a post about it later)</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otto-eboxi.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
