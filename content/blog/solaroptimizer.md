# Summary
Still a work in progres.
The idea is to monitor the solar generation and load scheduling and, based on the prediction, optimize the scheduleling of the high power loads, e.g. geyser and pool pump.

The idea is to only use local devices (no external server): Raspberri Pi as local server and ESP's as nodes.
